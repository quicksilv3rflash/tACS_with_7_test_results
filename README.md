# tACS_with_7_test_results

This repository contains both current and deprecated versions of the code. Use the current version
for administration of the test.

Preliminary test results included

I realized that I made an error in processing the maze EEG data files;
they're getting played back at double speed... which means the test results here are invalid
(at least as far as determining whether or not EEG playback can improve learning)
So much of this repository is now DEPRECATED!
(I've left deprecated pieces of it up so others can trace this project's history better)
