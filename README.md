# tACS_with_7_test_results
Preliminary test results included
...and I just realized that I made an error in processing the maze EEG data files...
They're getting played back at double speed... which means the test results here are invalid
(at least as far as determining whether or not EEG playback can improve learning)
So this repository is now DEPRECATED!
(I've left it up so others can trace this project's history better)
